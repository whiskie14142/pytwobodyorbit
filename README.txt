Python module for computations about Kepler orbit.

This module provide computations about Kepler orbits, including: 
  Compute Keplerian orbital elements from position and velocity, 
  Provide seriese of points on orbital trajectory for visualization, 
  Predict position and velocity of the object for given time, 
  Solve the Gauss problem (From given two positions and flight duration between 
  them, solveGauss() computes initial and terminal velocity of the object)
